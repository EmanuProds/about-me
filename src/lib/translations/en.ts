    description: "Hello, my name is Emanuel da Costa Pereira, I am a Full-Stack developer passionate about technology and innovation. My journey in technology began at age 9 with Windows XP and evolved into a passion for development and automation. A milestone in this journey was the creation of a shellscript that automates the complex post-installation of Arch Linux, a project that not only demonstrated my technical aptitude, but also revealed me as a programmer. In addition to having experience as an IT instructor at Microlins company, emphasizing my ability to teach and share knowledge. I am driven by curiosity and the desire for continuous learning, always looking for new opportunities where I can contribute and grow professionally.",
